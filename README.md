Alright, check this out:

**NEW RELEASE**

Super Simple Job Star Script for ESX

**What it does:**

* Shows GTA-style stars for Police Officers Online
* Made for ESX
* You can change the size, position, and jobs it works with
* That's pretty much it

**Why I made this:**

I saw a server using something like this and wanted it for myself. The only script I found cost a couple of bucks, and since I'm not made of money, I just made my own at 2 am. The code's a little messy, but hey, it works!

I'm making it totally free, so have fun with it!

**Preview**:
